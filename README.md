Using the site, you can search for books by certain criteria, such as genre, author, publication date, etc. This allows for a highly targeted search, saving you time and effort in finding books that match your preferences.

When developing the design and creating a convenient site for searching and saving books, a number of technologies were used, such as PyCharm, MySQL, Python, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, CSS. Thanks to this project, the following important conclusions were reached: 
1. Use PyCharm due to convenient and efficient code writing. Its integrated development environment provides advanced capabilities for autocompletion, debugging and version control, which facilitates the process of developing a web application.
2.  MySQL is a powerful relational database that ensures efficient storage and organization of data in an online library. Using the mysql.conector module allows you to conveniently interact with the database.
3. Python and Flask provide a powerful and easy-to-use framework for developing web applications
4. HTML, CSS and JavaScript play an important role in web design. With their help, you can create a convenient and aesthetic interface for users. The use of web standards allows to ensure compatibility with
all browsers and devices.
5. As a result of the work, a functional site was developed for searching and
saving books in the "saved" and "favorite" sections. MySQL database
is used for efficient data storage and organization.
The use of various technologies, in particular PyCharm, Python, Flask and HTML,
CSS, JavaScript, allows to create a convenient and attractive interface for
users. During the development of the project, valuable experience was gained in working with
web technologies and databases, which can be useful for the further
development of web applications and software in general.
